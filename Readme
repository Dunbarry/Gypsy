Gather 'round! And I will tell you a story,
(In less than 4 minutes or this could get gory)
Of a Chicagoland Golf Course Superintendent
who sought new fortune as a Colorado resident.

Through Galvanize skills multiplied,
both client-side and server-side,
he worked, he strived, he memorized.
But come Capstone time had to decide:

What problem did he seek to address?
A game industry obsessed with portraying women half-dressed?
With setting up violence as the only means of agency.
What could one developer's response to that be?

Squire Gypsy.

In Squire Gypsy and the Lost Blade you're young squire dreaming of glory,
who loses her sword at the start of the story.
She solves puzzles as she searches for it, and learns on the trip
that real power is not something you wear on your hip.
That when the realm is in trouble there's no need for stubble.
That not every problem requires violence in the end.
And that maybe, just maybe, not all white knights are men...

But let us return to our hero, as our time is nearing zero...

He wanted a major challenge when he decided to undertake this.
Not one foreign environment, but four.
(Apparently he's a masochist)
In Blender he modeled, in GIMP he made art.
Rendered with the Unity game engine and scripted in C#.
Before giving himself this project, none of which he knew.
Which means there were three other tools: The Unity API, Google, and youtube.

And oh, the animations! For a guy who grew grass
that's quite achievement but they were a pain in the...side.
Still, he believes in this story; a fairy tale modernized.
And there's so much more he wants to do: Only the first level is finalized!

So, spoiler warning: It's me. I'm who this story is about.
I know, I know, you're shocked! But please hear me out.

Yes, this is MY capstone, the fruits of what inspires me.
I'm Ryan A. Dunbar, and you should definitely hire me.
