Gather 'round! And I will tell you a story,
(In less than 4 minutes or this could get gory)
Of a Chicagoland Golf Course Superintendent
who sought new fortune as a Colorado resident.

Through Galvanize skills multiplied,
both client-side and server-side,
I worked, I strived, I memorized.
But come Capstone time I had to decide:

What problem do I seek to address?
An industry obsessed with portraying women half-dressed?
With setting up violence as the only means of agency.
So what's my response to this?

Squire Gypsy.

Squire Gypsy and the Lost Blade you're young squire dreaming of glory,
Who loses her sword at the start of the story.
She solves puzzles and explores, and learns on the trip
that real power is not something you wear on your hip.

I wanted a major challenge when I decided to undertake this.
Not one foreign environment, but four.
(Apparently I'm a masochist)
In Blender I modeled, in GIMP I made art.
Rendered with the Unity game engine and scripted in C#.
Before giving myself this project, none of which I knew.
Which means there were three other tools: The Unity API, Google, and youtube.
And oh, the animations! Now that was a task.
I'm proud of the achievement but it was a pain in the...side.

I believe in this story, a fairy tale modernized.
And there's so much more I want to do: Only the first level is finalized!
So this is my capstone, the fruits of what inspires me.
I'm Ryan A. Dunbar, and you should definitely hire me.
